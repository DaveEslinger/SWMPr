\title{Simple trend decomposition of monthly swmpr data}
\usage{
decomp_cj(swmpr_in, ...)

\method{decomp_cj}{swmpr}(swmpr_in, param, vals_out = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{swmpr_in}{input swmpr object}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to other methods, including \code{\link[wq]{decompTs}}}

\item{param}{chr string of variable to decompose}

\item{vals_out}{logical indicating of numeric output is returned, default is \code{FALSE} to return a plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} object if \code{vals_out = TRUE} (default), otherwise a monthly time series matrix of class \code{\link[stats]{ts}}.
}
\description{
Decompose monthly SWMP time series into grandmean, annual, seasonal, and event series using \code{\link[wq]{decompTs}}, as described in Cloern and Jassby 2010.
}
\details{
This function is a simple wrapper to the \code{\link[wq]{decompTs}} function in the wq package, also described in Cloern and Jassby (2010).  The function is similar to \code{\link{decomp.swmpr}} (which is a wrapper to \code{\link[stats]{decompose}}) with a few key differences.  The \code{\link{decomp.swmpr}} function decomposes the time series into a trend, seasonal, and random components, whereas the current function decomposes into the grandmean, annual, seasonal, and events components.  For both functions, the random or events components, respectively, can be considered anomalies that don't follow the trends in the remaining categories.

The \code{decomp_cj} function provides only a monthly decomposition, which is appropriate for characterizing relatively long-term trends.  This approach is meant for nutrient data that are obtained on a monthly cycle.  The function will also work with continuous water quality or weather data but note that the data are first aggregated on the monthly scale before decomposition.  Accordingly, short-term variation less than one-month will be removed.  The \code{\link{decomp.swmpr}} function can be used to decompose daily variation.

Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[wq]{decompTs}} can be used with \code{decomp_cj}, such as \code{startyr}, \code{endyr}, and \code{type}.  Values passed to \code{type} are \code{mult} (default) or \code{add}, referring to multiplicative or additive decomposition.  See the documentation for \code{\link[wq]{decompTs}} for additional explanation and examples.

\examples{
## get data
data(apacpnut)
dat <- apacpnut
dat <- qaqc(dat, qaqc_keep = NULL)

## decomposition of chl, values as data.frame
decomp_cj(dat, param = 'chla_n', vals_out = TRUE)

## decomposition of chl, ggplot
decomp_cj(dat, param = 'chla_n')

## decomposition changing argumens passed to decompTs
decomp_cj(dat, param = 'chla_n', startyr = 2008, type = 'add')

## monthly decomposition of continuous data
data(apacpwq)
dat2 <- qaqc(apacpwq)

decomp_cj(dat2, param = 'do_mgl')
